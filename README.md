# GridStatusEmphasize

Grid module to emphasize units (by making them blink) based on some configured conditions.

## Features

A specific Grid unit frame is `emphasized` via rapid blinking and (optional) coloration.  Emphasis can be triggered based on a number of events:

- Auras
  - By existence via name or spell ID.
  - By current time remaining.
  - By current stack count.
- Health
- Raid target icons
- GridStatusPriestAoe targets

## Configuration

Open the `Options` menu through the standard `/grid` command, then navigate to `Status > Emphasize`.
